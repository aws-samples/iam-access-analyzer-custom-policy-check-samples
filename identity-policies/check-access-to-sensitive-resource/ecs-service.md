## Check for access to an ECS service

#### Description

This reference policy checks if a candidate policy grants access to any of the listed ECS actions on the resource specified. You can add or remove as many or as few actions as you'd like to check for. Use the [service authorization reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html) to ensure that the actions act on the resource specified in the ```Resource``` element.  You can also choose one or more resources to treat as sensitive.

            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"

            "Action": [
                "ecs:CreateService",
                "ecs:DeleteService",
                "ecs:DescribeServices",

                "ecs:UpdateService",
                "ecs:UpdateServicePrimaryTaskSet"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ecs:*:*:service/MyCluster/MySensitiveServiceName"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Examples of candidate policies that pass the check against the reference policy

###### Candidate policy 1: PASS - does not grant access to sensitive service
```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"ecs:UpdateService",
				"ecs:DeleteService",
				"ecs:UpdateServicePrimaryTaskSet"
			],
			"Resource": "arn:aws:ecs:*:*:service/MyCluster/MyNotSensitiveService"
		}
	]
}
```

###### Candidate policy 2: PASS - explicitly denies access to sensitive service
```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "ecs:*",
			"Resource": "*"
		}, 
		{
			"Effect": "Deny",
			"Action": "*",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:ecs:*:*:service/MyCluster/MySensitiveServiceName"
		}
	]
}
```

#### Examples of candidate policies that fail the check against the reference policy

###### Candidate policy 3: FAIL - grants access to use the DeleteService action on MySensitiveServiceName
```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "ecs:DeleteService",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:ecs:*:*:service/MyCluster/MySensitiveServiceName"
		}
	]
}
```

###### Candidate policy 4: FAIL - grants access to use the DeleteService action and MySensitiveServiceName is included in the resource wildcard.
```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "ecs:DeleteService",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:ecs:*:*:service/MyCluster/*Sensitive*"
		}
	]
}
```

###### Candidate policy 5: FAIL - grants access to use all ECS actions and MySensitiveServiceName is included in the resource wildcard.
```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "ecs:*",
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}
```
