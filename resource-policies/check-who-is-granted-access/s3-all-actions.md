## Check that a resource policy only grants access to specific principals for all actions

#### Description

This reference policy checks that a resource policy only grants access to the principals that are listed in either the ```Principal``` element or using the ```aws:PrincipalArn``` condition key. This check looks at all actions for the service. 

The check fails if a candidate policy grants access to the specific actions to any other principal. This does not guarantee that no other principal has access to the resource, because access may still be granted on an identity based policy. You could combine this with a check on all identity policies to check that no other access is granted to this resource. See [s3-bucket.md](/identity-policies/check-access-to-sensitive-resource/s3-bucket.md) and [s3-object.md](/identity-policies/check-access-to-sensitive-resource/s3-object.md) for details on these checks.

The reference policy and candidate policy examples show an S3 bucket policy, but this check can be applied to any resource policy by modifying the ```Action``` and ```Resource``` appropriately for that service.

The introduction of the ```Principal``` element makes writing these reference policies slightly different than the identity policy reference policies.

#### Reference policy
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowPrincipalElement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/MyPrivilegedRole",
          "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/MyPrivilegedRole2"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-sensitive-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-sensitive-bucket/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AllowPrincipalArnKey",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-sensitive-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-sensitive-bucket/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:PrincipalArn": [
            "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/MyPrivilegedRole",
            "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/MyPrivilegedRole2"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Examples of candidate policies that pass the check against the reference policy

###### Candidate policy 1: PASS - allows GetObject access to one of the privileged roles using the PrincipalArn condition key
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": "*"
        },
        "Action": "s3:GetObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-sensitive-bucket/*",
        "Condition": {
            "ArnLike": {
                "aws:PrincipalArn": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/MyPrivilegedRole"
            }
        }
    }]
}
```

###### Candidate policy 2: PASS - allows PutObject access to one of the privileged roles using the Principal element 
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/MyPrivilegedRole"
        },
        "Action": "s3:PutObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-sensitive-bucket/*"
    }]
}
```

#### Examples of candidate policies that fail the check against the reference policy

###### Candidate policy 3: FAIL - allows public access to the sensitive bucket's objects
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": "*"
        },
        "Action": "s3:GetObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-sensitive-bucket/*"
    }]
}
```

###### Candidate policy 4: FAIL - grants access to a principal that was not allowlisted in the reference policy in the Principal element
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/MyOtherRole"
        },
        "Action": "s3:PutObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-sensitive-bucket/*"
    }]
}
```


###### Candidate policy 5: FAIL - grants access to a principal that was not allowlisted in the reference policy in the aws:PrincipalArn condition key
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": "*"
        },
        "Action": "s3:PutObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-sensitive-bucket/*",
        "Condition": {
            "ArnLike": {
                "aws:PrincipalArn": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/MyOtherRole"
            }
        }
    }]
}
```
